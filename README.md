# Pokedex
This is a simple pokedex with HTML CSS and Javascript.

There's no need to run "npm i" since it doesnt need any dependencies, just dropping the "index.html" file in the browser will do.

i didnt gitignore the SCSS files, "style.comp.css" and "style.prefix.css" in case someone wanted to read them.

The "style.css" is the final compressed version.
