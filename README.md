# Pokedex
This is a simple pokedex with HTML CSS and Javascript.

There's no need to run "npm i" since it doesnt need any dependencies, just dropping the "index.html" file in the browser will do.
The "style.css" is the compressed version, if you want to see the css code you can read the "style.comp.css" or "style.prefix.css",
which are for the scss compiled and auto-prefixed files respectively, or just read the scss which is divided by the 7-1 rule.
